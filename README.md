## Environment setup
This repo is heavely build on [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/tree/main). Please follow their repo to set-up and compile most things about 3D Gaussian Splatting. Beside, this code was tested with the following dependencies:

```
einops==0.7.0
Pillow==10.2.0
pymeshlab==2023.12.post1
scipy==1.12.0
wandb==0.15.12
```

### Clone our repo with submodules:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JiangWenPL/FisherRF.git --recursive
```

### Install extensions:
```bash
pip install submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/
pip install submodules/simple-knn/
pip install -e ./diff/ -v
```

### Download Datasets (Optional)
Please get the NeRF-synthetic from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1 (nerf_synthetic.zip).
The MipNeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/)

## Running our code

`active_train.py` is the entry to for our algorithm. You may use `-s` to specify the folder to the scene such as `.../blender/lego/` and `-m` for the folder of output. The folder name would be used as the `id` for wandb experiment.
You may choose the schema from `v20seq1_inplace` and `v20seq4_inplace` for batch selection

<!-- Run training and testing on Blender and Mip360 dataset with different configuration: -->
Please use scripts under `./scripts/` to run different experiments with different configurations. The first arguments of the script is the path to the scene that contains `trainsforms_*.json` and the second is the path which you would like to save your experiment. For example:
```bash
bash scripts/blender_seq1.sh /PATH/TO/YOUR/DATASET/lego YOUR_EXP_PATH
```
