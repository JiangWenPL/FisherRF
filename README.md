## Environment setup
This repo is heavely build on [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/tree/main). Please follow their repo to set-up and compile most things about 3D Gaussian Splatting. Beside, this code was tested with the following dependencies:

```
einops==0.7.0
Pillow==10.2.0
pymeshlab==2023.12.post1
scipy==1.12.0
wandb==0.15.12
```

### Clone our repo with submodules:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JiangWenPL/FisherRF.git --recursive
```

### Install extensions:
```bash
pip install submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/
pip install submodules/simple-knn/
pip install -e ./diff/ -v
```

### Download Datasets (Optional)
Please get the NeRF-synthetic from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1 (nerf_synthetic.zip).
The MipNeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/)

## Running our code

Please use scripts under `./scripts/` to run different experiments with different configurations. The first arguments of the script is the path to the scene that contains `trainsforms_*.json` and the second is the path which you would like to save your experiment. For example:
```bash
bash scripts/blender_seq1.sh /PATH/TO/YOUR/DATASET/lego YOUR_EXP_PATH
```

## Uncertainty Estimation on LF Dataset

Obtain LF dataset [here](https://github.com/poetrywanderer/CF-NeRF?tab=readme-ov-file#data). You may need to preprocess the LF dataset following the [direction](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#processing-your-own-scenes) in the original 3D-GS.

Example: `statue`

```bash
# train
bash scripts/lf_cfnerf.sh /mnt/kostas-graid/datasets/wen/LF/ test-lf-statue statue

# render uncertainty
python render_uncertainty.py -m test-lf-statue --override_idxs statue

# calculate ause
python ause.py gaussian statue -m test-lf-statue --data_dir /path/to/LF/dataset
```

## Active Mapping Experiments

The active mapping part of our method is in a seperate [repo](https://github.com/JiangWenPL/FisherRF-active-mapping/). Please checkout the README for setup.
